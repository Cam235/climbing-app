# climbingapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Some changes have been made to turn it into an app to log indoor bouldering climbs. Currently can log climbs, upload pictures and add descriptions.

Future aims:
- Indoor map of local climbing gyms in which location can be referenced.
  - Maybe even the ability to draw/add others locally.
- More options when logging climbs.
- Highlight holds on the provided image. (As long as colour/details are provided)
